The first time you open your terminal and write `rails new` it can be overwhelming the sheer number of files and folders that are created. You may even work on numerous Rails projects without ever opening many of these folders, but what exactly are they? What are they doing behind the scenes? Well, the truth is that you don’t need many of them and Rails has several flags built into the `new` command (to learn more just type out `rails new —help`) which will allow you to create a new project without some of the builtin defaults of Rails. That said for most projects you’ll be running `rails new` and creating a beastly project folder. In this post I’m going to go through every single file and folder in a new Rails 6 project. Feel free to use this as a reference as you are working through your new Rails project to understand some of the more obscure folders. Bookmark this post and return to it anytime you find yourself in the weeds on a new Rails project.
