  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hey, I'm Travis Fantina. I'm a full stack developer and hobbiest designer.
    Currently at <a href="https://www.objectiveinc.com/">Objective</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I dabble in anything and everything that intrersts me. Mostly I work with,
    Ruby and Rails, Elixir, and JavaScript, but it's not out of the ordinary for
    me to dabble with Django or play with WordPress.
  </p>
  <p>

      At the moment I'm working full time for a consultancy and not actively
      taking on new clients but I'd still love to hear from you.
    </p>

    I started playing with HTML and CSS back in 2003-2004 that era, it was a dark
    time, corners were rounderd with GIFs, layouts were done with tables.  It was
    not a lot of fun, but I loved the idea that I could make anything and it could
    be seen/read/used by, potentially, anyone in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    I tried many forays into programming throughout highschool but never stuck with
    it.  I used the WordPress 5 minute install, and knew enough ActionScript to make
    dumb little Flash games but that was all I needed for a time.
    <p>
    Around 2015 I was in a design class at Brigham Young Univesity where I was
    introduced to Ruby on Rails by <a href="https://rayelder.com/">Ray Elder</a>.
    Ruby was a gateway drug into a world that I had skrited for many years but
    never comitted too, the power, beauty and flexability of the language made me
    feel like I could do anything.  Gone were the days of printing "hello world"
    and getting board, I was building websites!
      </p>
    <p>
    Since that time I have been designing and developing projects for myself and
    others on a freelance basis and more recently at <a href="https://www.objectiveinc.com/">Objective</a>.
    Check out our work, we were best in state last year.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the side I continue to tirelessly prusue side projects most recently I've
    been building <a href="https://dinnerlove.herokuapp.com/">DinnerLove - ðŸ¥‘</a>
    a place to disover and plan your next meal.
